# WTF Is This?

What follows is something I have needed to get off my chest since the 7th grade.  If anything, I can summarize it as this: I have always loved you, deeply. But I never felt good enough to be your friend. That's what it is.  That's it.  Nothing more. :-)  

What this is not, is some sort of fucked up, attempt to "make up" for some past mistakes.  It's not a love letter (in the traditional sense).  This will be a little bit more clearer later but, if you're husband is reading this (which I encourage btw, hi!), perhaps it will give him some additional insight into how awesome you were before he met you.  Otherwise, it's just some clarity that one person (me, duh) wants to provide to another person (you, duh) around some event that, up until now, I honestly only saw one way.

I try to write a little poetically with some semblance of structure, so please forgive the whole 'meter' of the piece.

Additionally, I write a lot and often.  I do have a habit of writing letters to my friends, mostly alive, some dead.  They are almost never sent. You are one of the few where it was important enough for me to send.

# How Did I Get Here?

But let's start with how did I (and now we) end up getting to this point. My apologies for the whorish utilization of the Oxford comma throughout...

My reaching out to you a few years ago wasn't so much a "Jean, I miss you for whatever reason and lets be friends again," it was more, "Jean, for reasons I won't go into, there are some things I need to tell you for my own completeness before its all over."
My mind is tortured. And when it really travels down that slippery abyss, the only solution is to silence those demons, stop the torture.

The funny thing is, in spite of the brief interactions we've had, I've never had a chance to tell you what follows; which is why I continued to reach out.  Mission incomplete, man.

# But Then (Or Quantum Superposition)

When you did call me back, and after the quick pleasantries, I was taken aback by your  first, real question, "So, did you marry someone in your race?"

Do you ever get those quick lifetime flashbacks around a certain person or event?  Almost everything that has happened between you and the other, but in the most surrealist of light? Every previous interaction, conscious or not?  All played out in less than a moment? Caused by one innocent rhetorical that forces you to question your entire perception of what you think/know to be objective reality?

Well, if I truly understood the underpinnings of that question than it appears that you may be about to experience the same phenomena. If I misunderstood, it doesn't really change anything anyways, and I totally apologize for reading too much into that particular question. 

So here's my flashback with full transparency and for your entertainment. Let's see where we go with this, huh?

# You 

My wife likes to joke, "You're the first love-of-my-life or her only competition." Here's the thing she knows, that you don't:

*I never thought I was good enough for you, and it was never even close.*

Since Mrs Butkowski's class, I can remember being so enamored with you. I loved your dry wit, the dripping sarcasm, your "childish maturity," your intelligence.  I loved you.

As we progressed through high school together, I saw you killing it.  Not just academically (you were well beyond the Asian archetype; true genius-level shit), but even with the way you handled stupid assholes that were 2 years older than you, myself included. (Or sometimes 3 years, Aaron Arquilla, cough, cough).

Now look, I didn't know it/feel it at the time, but I didn't feel smart. I knew I was an underachiever.  People told me that I was pretty smart. I knew that my brother was pretty smart.  But I myself, just didn't care enough?

*But I never thought I was smart enough for you, and it wasn't even close.*

I can remember one day in particular, we were in some classroom (maybe health?) and Eric Crandall told you to come and sit on his lap for a second; which you innocently did. That asshole flashed me a smile as if to say, "Life is fun when you're this good looking."

And he was right. Good-looking guy with most beautiful girl I had ever seen?  I was seething.  I wished I could have had the courage to just ask you out and he had you sitting on his lap. I hated him for that. 

*But I never thought I was good looking enough for you. You deserved so much better, even as something as trivial as aesthetic beauty and I wasn't even close.*

I can remember the last day I actually saw you. Summer, 1994. It was our first summer back from school. You called me. I actually drove up from Champaign. We met up at the Signature Lounge. The waiter didn't card us and we had martinis and stared at the West Side (we may have moved to the east briefly). It's imprinted. You don't know this, but I spent the last of my money that night. My dog and I lived on couch change and french fries for 2 days after that.  Worth it.

*And I never really thought I was going to be successful enough for you, and it wasn't even close.*

I remember growing up with all the prejudicial peer-pressuring.  Marry an Egyption.  Marry a Copt.  People stay within their races.  (It gets better...)  Asians typically don't like the brownies... 

*And I thought well, I can't be Asian for you.* (Laugh dammit. That was gold.)

And I realized as I was going home that night, that you were destined for something bigger. Me? I was smoking so much weed, mushrooms and acid were my best friends, cigarettes replaced oxygen, and cocaine... well, cocaine is a helluva drug. I was trying to figure out how NOT to finish school.  (FYI, I decided to go the traditional route and just fail spectacularly).

And that's when the 4th dimension comes along and says, "Silly boy, in your silly 3D world; she's too good for you. Ever heard of vectors?  Well, your stupid ass is going going in a separate direction with differing magnitude.  Or put another way, Jesus, you're a moron, she's too good for you.  Reason #1,783." 

So that's when I resigned myself to the fact, that vis a vis as it pertains to you, that was it. I just couldn't compete.  But it was more than that, I think I put you on such a pedestal that I kept hurting my neck looking up.  Or put another way, at some point you just figure that it was never meant to be.

*I wasn't good enough for you.*

Funny thing is you had no idea about any of this.  Or at least I'm guessing.  Because if you did...

# Commercial Break

As an aside, one of the stimulating factors for this letter was a random conversation I had with a random person who turned out to be Nobel Peace Prize winner (he's a moron, but that's a story for another day), right before I reached out to you.

This isn't a humble-brag, because I can best be described as a highly-functioning college-dropout dipshit who wasted many a decade; but he encouraged me to finally finish my schooling at UofC. This was honestly the first time, I thought, "If Jean was here right now, she'd be so proud of me."

(Or put another way, "Maybe I am good enough for her now." Not in the romantic love sense, but just in the basic humanity sense.  I finally felt like I could reach out and not have you think of me as a waste of space.)

# Epilogue

And so I did reach out, with my own newly-found reality firmly in place, ready to admit a number of things to you (ranked from least important to most important):

1. That you were the first love of my life.  Only immediately succeeded by my wife Rania. This was only important from the sense of "John, why did you reach out to me after all these years?" accompanied with a full explanation (this)
2. That you were my closest friend and I genuinely missed your companionship as one might their right or left pinkie. (yes, there's Brad, Leo, Phil; but they're my boys, they don't count for our purposes here.)  Things change I realize, but I was taking my shot.  You're comment about how I was your best friend in school, felt like a punch to the nads.
3. And even as an atheist, to ask your forgiveness.  (I know, I know; there's a paradox in there somewhere.) I was not, am not a good friend to you.

Now from my vantage point, I'm done.  *Except,* you said what you did. Did you feel the same?  And if so, then you consequently seem to have some resentment towards me.  If the irony of life is such, then my admission here should hopefully put everything into context.

So that's it. I love you. I miss you. I dream of you often. This isn't a romantic thing (anymore) but it is something that I needed complete before I lose my life or mind (the latter is probably going to happen first, but I am taking bets.)



# Closing

You are Jean.

You left such an impression on me, that it took me 30 years to get this out of my head and unto a digital piece of paper.

I loved you deeply.  I had to let you go because, at least I think, at its most fundamental, the way I felt about you made me feel bad (not insecure, more like a living, unfulfilled potential piece of poo) about myself.  But if my suspicions are correct (and they rarely are, and even if  they are not), that might have been the single dumbest thing I've ever done.

I would like a chance to have my friend back. To offer her the friendship that I failed to before. I have nothing to offer but boring existential (of shit with no pragmatic) talk, never-ending absurdist references, the occasional fart joke, et al. To say that there are responsibilities that friends have to one another, and I want to sign up to your organization and monthly newsletter.  However, I do not like to buy chocolates or M&M's for charity, so send your minions elsewhere.

I understand that you may have no interest. Believe me, the number of people I've written off in the last 10 years alone could fill a small 132-page novella (looks around sheepishly). That point-of-view is reasonable and sympathetic.  I promise you will never hear from me again.

But I must admit that writing this was therapeutic. Again, I apologize for any misunderstandings, hurt, and pain I've ever caused you. While I regret the way our friendship fizzled out, I do not regret any of my thoughts and feelings I have shared with you here and perhaps provided a bit of clarity around why I'm such an asshole.

I wish you so much love, laughter, good fortune, parental sanity (3 kids? wtf is wrong with you?), strong winds, clean bathroom facilities, and the like.
